# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning  

A deep learning-based project to detect brain tumors from MRI scans.  
Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** for model training and **Flask** for deploying a web-based interface.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features  
âœ… **Custom Deep Learning Model** â€“ Train from scratch using `model.ipynb`.  
âœ… **Automated Training Pipeline** â€“ Preprocesses data, trains CNN, and saves the model.  
âœ… **Web Application** â€“ Run `app.py` to launch a Flask web app for image upload & prediction.  
âœ… **Interactive UI** â€“ Simple web interface to check MRI scan results in real-time.
